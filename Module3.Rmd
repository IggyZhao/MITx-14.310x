## Summarizing and Describing Data

The goal of visualisation is either EDA for yourself or for conveying a message to other people.  The course uses ggplot in both instances, this module focuses more on EDA for yourself. 

One common way of initially looking at the data is to use a histogram, which provides a rough estimate of the probability distribution function (PDF) of a continous variable.  We can have right open or closed sets when creating histogram bins $[a_i,b_i), [a_{i+1},b_{i+1})$ see this video for a [discussion on binning](https://youtu.be/kREoWbByNZs).
