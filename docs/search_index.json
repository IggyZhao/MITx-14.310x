Suppose we have some random variable x, we want to know how a new random variable Y = h(X) (some function of x) is distributed. If we have a distribution \\(Y = |2x| + 3\\) where X has a PDF \\(f_x(x) = 1 - |x| \\; for -1 &lt;= x &lt;= 1\\). We can think about what each element does to the random variable as we move from x to y as shown below e.g. we start with x, then move to 2x, then to the absolute value of X then in the final image we add 3 three which moves the distribution along to the right.
