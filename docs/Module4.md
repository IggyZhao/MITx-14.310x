## Functions of Random Variables

Before discussing statistics, we need to understand probability and how random variables behave.  

Suppose we have some random variable x, we want to know how a new random variable Y = h(X) (some function of x) is distributed.  If we have a distribution $Y = |2x| + 3$ where X has a PDF $f_x(x) = 1 - |x| \; for -1 <= x <= 1$. We can think about what each element does to the random variable as we move from x to y as shown below e.g. we start with x, then move to 2x, then to the absolute value of X then in the final image we add 3 three which moves the distribution along to the right.
